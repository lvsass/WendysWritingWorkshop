# Exercise 7: Advertisement

> Choose a photographic advertisement. Identify the elements of the advertisement. Write what it expresses as a short sequence of sentences. What are the premises, and what are the remedies that the product offers? How do the elements in the image function to make this statement? (You may want to take a look at Roland Barthes’ famous essay, “The Rhetoric of the Image,” originally published in 1967, from which this exercise takes inspiration.)

A leopard walks on water in a pool of water, which looks perfectly still. Perhaps it’s one of these infinity pools, but over the horizon, a faint landscape appears like the grand canyon or an exotic desert terrain. The leopard’s reflection on the water is studded with diamonds and black onyx, sparkling with emerald eyes. There’s only one word, Cartier, over one of the ripples emanating from the leopard’s steps. 
What is the premise of this surreal landscape? How could a leopard walk on water? The landscape is mysterious, vacant, and ultimately unlocatable. The dislocated landscape signifies an aloofness–an unattainable other.
