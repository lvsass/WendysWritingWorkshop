1. The photography collection at Getty Research Institute provides a critical mass of imagery for studying the dynamics of this shift in visual culture [A visual criminalization of Chinese males.]. The Second Opium War (1856–60) and the Boxer Uprising (1900–01) anchor the period of focus.

The development of early photographic technologies coincided with imperialist and colonialist campaigns on China. These were campaigns that elicited more than half a century of bloody conflicts, such as the Second Opium War (1856–60)—which resulted in the cession of many Chinese territories—and the Boxer Uprising (1900–01)—an anti-imperialist, anti-foreign uprising which to the looting, rape and occupation of Chinese cities and their governments. The photographic ethnography that accompanied the colonial forces on their assault, went from the representation of singular racial stereotypes to a depiction of racial and national essences—punitive essences that were largely defined in terms of negativity, criminality, and pathology.

2. Jean Prouvé's *B.L.P.S* weekend house was designed in 1937, measured 3.3 × 3.3 m, was made of steel and weighed 2 tons.

In the interwar period, many designers experimented with industrial production techniques that became more viable, being inflamed by the European war-machine. In the wake of the Second World War, in 1937 the French government announced the introduction of paid vacation for workers. As a response, Jean Prouvé designed the B.L.P.S an early prefab weekend home that was sturdy—being made of steel—and could be built up and taken down in a matter of hours—weighing only 2 tons. After the war, designs based on the B.L.P.S were extremely useful against the ensuing housing shortage.
